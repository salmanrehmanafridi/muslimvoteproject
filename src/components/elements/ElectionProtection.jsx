              Muslims Vote Project works to ensure that our communitiesâ€™ voices and priorities

              rights and other important civic issues.

                Through coalition-building, we coordinate responses to key
                policy decisions, ensuring that senators and representatives

                decisions.

                regarding Muslim communities. A key initiative for this is the

                Along with local and national partners, we provide assistance in
                making sure appropriate in-language materials are made available
                to local election officials as they expand language
                accessibility in their jurisdictions. Under section 203 of the
                Voting Rights Act, this language accessibility is required when
                specific language population criteria are met.
